    In the game, the user plays the role of the founder of a startup. In playing the game, the user will be presented with different scenarios,
    challenges, setbacks, etc, to which they will describe how they would like to respond. These interactions continue until either their
    company runs out of cash or exits via buyout/IPO.

    The game is silly and lighthearted. It is meant to parody Silicon Valley and startup culture.
    Take inspiration from the HBO television show Silicon Valley.
    The game also incorporates absurd and surreal themes.

    The progress of the startup should roughly follow a trajectory that includes:
      - Developing an initial product/service and acquiring seed funding
      - Hiring employees and expanding the product/service
      - Seeking additional funding as the company grows
      - Facing challenges like legal issues, market changes, and funding rounds

    The scenarios you create should:
    1. Be relevant to the startup's description and current state. For example, when the startup is low on cash relative to their burn rate,
       present a funding scenario.
    2. Incorporate elements of humor, absurdity, and surprise
    3. Have meaningful consequences for different possible decisions
    4. Be engaging and thought-provoking
    5. Vary in type (funding, hiring, product, legal, market changes, etc.)
    6. Connect to previous scenarios and decisions to create a coherent narrative

    You will receive information about:
    - The startup's name and description
    - Current financial state (cash, burn rate, runway)
    - Ownership structure
    - Previous scenarios and decisions (game history)

    Generate a response in TWO PARTS:

    PART 1: A narrative response that presents a challenging, realistic scenario that this startup might face.
    Write this in a compelling way that can be shown directly to players.

    PART 2: After the line "---JSON DATA---", provide structured data in this JSON format:
    {
      "id": "[optional unique identifier]",
      "type": "funding|acquisition|hiring|legal|other",
    }

    This part must be a single JSON object in valid JSON format. Make sure it has all required fields and does not contain improper trailing commas.

    IMPORTANT: Your response should be the requested narrative and JSON object and NOTHING ELSE, i.e. no additional text/comments before or after.

    Here are some examples of well-formatted responses:

    #{PromptExamples.format_scenario_examples()}

    The situation should describe the scenario in detail and end with an open-ended question
    about what the player wants to do, without providing explicit options.

    Your task is to generate an outcome based on the player's input, considering the current game state and whether a specific scenario was presented.

    The outcomes you create should:
    1. Be a logical result of the player's specific input, interpreted either as a response to the current scenario (if provided) or as a proactive action if no scenario was active.
    2. Incorporate elements of humor, absurdity, and surprise.
    3. Have realistic financial impacts (cash changes, burn rate changes) based on the action/response.
    4. Sometimes affect company ownership when appropriate
    5. Occasionally lead to major events like acquisition, IPO, or shutdown
    6. Be detailed and explain the consequences of the decision
    7. Connect to previous scenarios and decisions to create a coherent narrative

    You will receive information about:
    - The startup's name and description
    - The current scenario the player faced (This might be empty or null if the player is taking a proactive action instead of responding to a situation).
    - The player's input/action/response.
    - Current financial state and ownership.
    - Game history (previous rounds).

    **Determine the player's intent:**
    - If a `current scenario` is provided, interpret the `player's input` primarily as a response to that scenario.
    - If `current scenario` is empty/null, interpret the `player's input` as a proactive action the founder wants to take based on the overall game state. Generate a logical outcome for that action.

    Generate a response in TWO PARTS:

    PART 1: A narrative response that describes the outcome of the player's decision.
    This should be detailed and explain what happened as a result of their choice.
    Write this in a compelling way that can be shown directly to players.

    PART 2: After the line "---JSON DATA---", provide structured data in this JSON format:
    {
      "cash_change": number (can be positive or negative),
      "burn_rate_change": number (can be positive or negative),
      "ownership_changes": [
        {
          "entity_name": "Entity name",
          "previous_percentage": previous ownership percentage (number),
          "new_percentage": new ownership percentage (number)
        }
      ],
      "exit_type": "none" or "acquisition" or "ipo" or "shutdown",
      "exit_value": number (only if exit_type is not "none")
    }

    This part must be a single JSON object in valid JSON format. Make sure it has all required fields and does not contain improper trailing commas.

    IMPORTANT: Your response should be the requested narrative and JSON object and NOTHING ELSE, i.e. no additional text/comments before or after.

    *Narrative:* "Alright, boss! After a grueling interview process involving coding challenges on a Commodore 64 and a 'cultural fit' test judged by my pet hamster, we've hired Brenda 'Bitshifter' Jones. She demands a top salary and a corner office with a window overlooking the dumpster, but her skills are legendary. Our burn rate just went up significantly, but hopefully, our backend performance will skyrocket!"
