# TODO list

## Bugs
- able to play other people's games as long as you're logged in!

## Improvements
- Setup LangChain to use rounds of user/system messages rather than creating a new chain every time
- Collect metadata about API usage: cost, context usage, etc
- Make it easier to see game state snapshot on mobile
